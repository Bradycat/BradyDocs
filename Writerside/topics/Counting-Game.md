<p>Now that you have activated the Counting Game, I will explain the individual things that it does.</p>
<chapter title="/counting buysaves" id="buysaves" collapsible="true">
    <p>This allows you to buy a “rescue platform”, so to speak. All users get at start 2 saves.</p>
    <p>This means that if the number is 2, but the user writes 23, this is not saved as an error in the counting stats, but you can still not continue counting directly and have to wait for the next user.</p>
</chapter>
<chapter title="/counting stats" id="stats" collapsible="true">
    <p>You can use this to display your counting stats.</p>
